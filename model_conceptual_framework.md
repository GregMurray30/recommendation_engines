MODEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK This model utitizes basic network theory and Bellman-Ford
shortest path algorithm to generate movie recommendations. This model description serves
as the conceptual framework only and does not reflect the model's literal implementation
in PySpark.

Dual-Cluster User-Movie Network: The dual-cluster, user-movie network consists of two
principal network clusters with nodes in a power-law-like distribution. The first cluster
is the user network, which is a weighted, non-directed, cyclic graph. The second network
cluster is the movie network, also a weighted, non-directed, cyclic graph. Finally, the 
two clusters are connected by the user-movienetwork. It is a weighted, directed and cyclic 
graph composed of cross-edges representing each user's rating of each movie. As the name 
implies, the user-movie network shares nodes with the user and movie networks.

The user network nodes represent individual users. The network's edge weights are
calculated as the average magnitudinal difference of their shared-movie ratings. The weights are
non-directed. in that they may be either negative or positive. Accordingly, the sign of
the weight indicates the direction of the edge. The node pairs still show up twice (A-B
and B-A) in the graph's edge list where w<sub>AB</sub>=-1(w<sub>BA</sub>). The intuition
behind permitting negative weights is demonstrated in the following example.


In order to accommodate a belief that an increase in degree separation should correspond to 
a decrease in the similarity regardless of the values of the edge weights, a weighting 
function f(E) is applied to each node traversal originating from the same cluster. Formally, 
f(E<sub>uv</sub>) = λE<sub>uv</sub>, where u, v ∈ C(1,2); and P<sub>E<sub>ij</sub></sub> ∈ P<sub>m</sub>; 
where λ is the weighting parameter, and P<sub>m</sub> is plane m.

The movie network nodes represent individual movies. Reciprocating the user network, the
movie network's edge weights are the average net difference in their shared-user
ratings. Also, as in the user network, the movie network is a directed graph with signed
edge weights.

The user-movie network consists of cross edges spanning the user and movie clusters and
connect a user to the movie they have rated where node u ∈ G<sub>user</sub>, and node v
∈ G<sub>movie</sub>. In order for a high rating to correspond to a small distance, a
rating-rank is used in (rating of 5 is a 1, rating of 4 is 2, etc.) for the edge weight
in place of the actual rating.

Finally, movie recommendations are generated by ranking the user-to-movie traversals of
the shortest distances.

One of the advantages of using a multi-cluster network model is that the user's movie
ratings, her similarity to other users, and her rated movies similarities to other
movies are not assessed in some arbitrary order. In addition, each plane's edge distances
may be weighted according to one's beliefs on the impact that particular network*.

 *In this iteration of the model the distances in the user network, movie network, and the
 user-movie cross network are scaled the same, assigning each network equal impact on the
 final recommendation. These edge weights could easily be scaled to accomodate one's
 beliefs on the importance each network has in determining the right movie recommendation.
 For instance if one believed that movie similarity was more important than user
 similarity, the edge weights in the movie network plane could be scaled down by some
 factor.
