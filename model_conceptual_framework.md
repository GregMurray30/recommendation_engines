MODEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK This model utitizes basic network theory and Bellman-Ford
shortest path algorithm to generate movie recommendations. This model description serves
as the conceptual framework only and does not reflect the model's literal implementation
in PySpark.

Dual-Cluster User-Movie Network: The dual-cluster, user-movie network consists of two
principal network clusters with nodes in a power-law-like distribution. The first cluster
is the user network, which is a weighted, directed, cyclic graph. The second network
cluster is the movie network. Finally, the two clusters are connected by the user-movie
network. It is a weighted, directed and cyclic graph composed of cross-edges representing
each user's rating of each movie. As the name implies, the user-movie network shares nodes
with the user and movie networks.

  The user network nodes represent individual users. The network's edge weights are
  calculated as the average net difference of their shared-movie ratings. The weights are
  directional in that they may be either negative or positive. Accordingly, the sign of
  the weight indicates the direction of the edge. The node pairs still show up twice (A-B
  and B-A) in the graph's edge list where w<sub>AB</sub>=-1(w<sub>BA</sub>). The intuition
  behind permitting negative weights is demonstrated in the following example.

   i.e.: User A rates movie X a 2 while user B rates movie X a 5. In addition, user A
   rates movie Y a 1 while user C rates movie Y a 5. User B has not rated movie Y and user
   C has not rated movie X. Since the edge weights are calculated as the average
   difference in the net ratings between users, edge BA is 3 and edge AC is -4 (G(V,E):
   B--->A<----C). Since user B and user C both differ largely in taste from user A, they
   are more similar to each other than to user A, and therefore the distance should be
   small. This issue is resolved by using signed edge weights, where the distance between
   node B and node C is -1, as opposed to a weight of 7 in a non-directed graph.

   There is one problem that arises with directed edge approach in this context: a 2nd
   degree connection distance may be equal to, and therefore impact the movie
   recommendation identically as, a 1st degree connection distance. It is my belief that
   as the degrees of separation increase, the similarity should decrease. The simple
   solution to this problem is assigning a weighting function f(E) to each node. This
   function is applied whenever an intra-network node is traversed. Formally,
   f(E<sub>uv</sub>) = λE<sub>uv</sub>, where u, v ∈ C(1,2); and
   P<sub>E<sub>ij</sub></sub> ∈ P<sub>m</sub>; where λ is the weighting parameter, and
   P<sub>m</sub> is plane m.

  The movie network nodes represent individual movies. Reciprocating the user network, the
  movie network's edge weights are the average net difference in their shared-user
  ratings. Also, as in the user network, the movie network is a directed graph with signed
  edge weights.

  The user-movie network consists of cross edges spanning the user and movie clusters and
  connect a user to the movie they have rated where node u ∈ G<sub>user</sub>, and node v
  ∈ G<sub>movie</sub>. In order for a high rating to correspond to a small distance, a
  rating-rank is used in (rating of 5 is a 1, rating of 4 is 2, etc.) for the edge weight
  in place of the actual rating.

  Finally, movie recommendations are generated by ranking the user-to-movie traversals of
  the shortest distances.

  One of the advantages of using a multi-cluster network model is that the user's movie
  ratings, her similarity to other users, and her rated movies similarities to other
  movies are not applied with arbitrary priority. In addition, each plane's edge distances
  may be weighted according to one's beliefs on the impact that particular network*.

 *In this iteration of the model the distances in the user network, movie network, and the
 user-movie cross network are scaled the same, assigning each network equal impact on the
 final recommendation. These edge weights could easily be scaled to accomodate one's
 beliefs on the importance each network has in determining the right movie recommendation.
 For instance if one believed that movie similarity was more important than user
 similarity, the edge weights in the movie network plane could be scaled down by some
 factor.
