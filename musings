Brainstorming of ideas for improving this model:

Shortcomings:
-Two people with a shared "enemy" are currently considered, mathematically, more dissimilar than their enemy.This may be the 
case but it could also be the opposite.
-One major problem is that sample size is not being incorporated 
-What do you do with 0 variance node pairs??

Solution Ideas:

-To address sample size uncertainty you could use a Bayesian approach where the likelihood was the distribution mentioned above.
For the prior you could pick the overall mean, or somehow determine clusters with homogeneity scores to determine a prior distribution estimate.
