# MODEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
>#### **by Greg Murray**
## INTRODUCTION
The recommender system proposed detailed in this description is a hybrid model utilizing components of user-based nearest neighbor, and item-based nearest neighbor receommenders, as well as basic network theory. There are two models used for determining recommendations for users, the scalar model ([USER_MOVIE_NETWORK.py](https://github.com/GregMurray30/recommendation_engines/blob/master/USER_MOVIE_NETWORK.py)), and the Gaussian model ([USER_MOVIE_NETWORK_gaussian.py](https://github.com/GregMurray30/recommendation_engines/blob/master/USER_MOVIE_NETWORK_gaussian.py)). Aside from their edge weightings, both the scalar  and Gaussian networks are modelled identically and
utilize Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to generate item[<sup>1</sup>](#1) recommendations.

The user-movie network is a weighted, non-directed and a-cyclic graph consisting of two node types, user and movie nodes, with node centrality typically in a skewed normal or power-law-like distribution.

## SCALAR NETWORK MODEL
Each node of type user represents an individual user in this network model. The network's edge weights are
calculated as the mean magnitudinal difference between the two nodes' shared-movies' ratings. The weights are
non-directed, however, the user node pairs still show up twice (*A-B* and *B-A*) 
in the graph's edge list where **w<sub>*AB*</sub>=w<sub>*BA*</sub>**.

The second type of node in this model is the movie node which represent individual movies. Reciprocating the user nodes, the
movie network's edge weights are the mean magnitudinal difference between the two nodes' shared-users'
ratings. 

Cross edges connecting a user node to a movie node indicate the user's rating of that movie
where node **u ∈ G<sub>user</sub>**, and node **v ∈ G<sub>movie</sub>**. In order for a high rating 
to correspond to a small distance, a rating-rank is used in (rating of 5 is a 1, rating of 4 
is 2, etc.) for the edge weight in place of the actual rating.

In order to accommodate a belief that an increase in degree separation should correspond to 
a decrease in the similarity regardless of the values of the edge weights, a weighting 
parameter **λ** is added to the distance function, *δ(E)*; compounding the the distance for each node traversal originating from the same node type. Formally, 
  
  > **δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; λ) = λE<sub>uv</sub>**, where **N<sub>x</sub>** is node type x, and where **N<sub>u</sub>=N<sub>v</sub>.**

Finally, movie recommendations are generated by ranking the user-to-movie traversals by shortest distances.

One of the advantages of using a dual-node-type network model is that the user's movie
ratings, her similarity to other users, and her rated movies' similarities to other
movies are not considered in any arbitrary order, but rather assessed simultaneously[<sup>2</sup>](#2). 
In addition, each node type's edge distances may be weighted according to one's beliefs about the impact 
that particular type.

## GAUSSIAN NETWORK MODEL:

The Gaussian network model is identical to the scalar network except for the calculation of the
edge weight distances. Where the edge weights in the scalar model are simply the mean magnitude
of the rating differences, the Gaussian model's edge weights are the probability that the
difference between two users, or two movies, is greater than some designated threshold parameter **θ**.

**Figure 2:** *A representation of the Gaussian Network Model. The varying thicknesses of each edge line represent different probabilities of similarity. Notice that the movie and user networks are not two separate clusters, but rather an mesh of the two node types inextricably linked by their complex relational edges.*
 
One major disadvantage of the probabilistic approach to edge weights is that since the Gaussian probability density is ![alt text](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4abaca87a10ecfa77b5a205056523706fe6c9c3f "Title"), it is undefined for samples with a variance of zero. It can be shown that the CDF for a Gaussian with zero variance is defined as ![alt text](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90400cbbc8895d9f3c9a62d7502ed0f077c6ee3b).
However, because many of the instances with zero variance are clearly more a result of small sample size than two users' unwavering similarity, this CDF is not a practical solution to the zero variance problem (which is really a sample size problem). Instead, when variance is zero, and where the mean difference is less than the threshold parameter **θ**, distance is calculated using a scaled version of the logistic function, *δ(n)=e<sup>n</sup>/(1000+e<sup>n</sup>)* [<sup>*</sup>](#3), where **n** is the sample size. In the case where the mean difference is greater than the threshold parameter and the variance is zero, the edge is set equal to infinity, effectively removing the two nodes' connection from the network. Formally, distance in this network is calculated where
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)=Pr[N(μ<sub>uv</sub>, σ<sub>uv</sub>)>θ]**, when **σ<sub>uv</sub>>0** and **μ<sub>uv</sub><=θ**;
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)=1-e<sup>n<sub>uv</uv></sup>/(1000+e<sup>n</sup>)**, when **σ<sub>uv</sub>=0** and **μ<sub>uv</sub><=θ**, where n is the sample size of **E<sub>uv</sub>**;
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)= ∞**, otherwise

Despite its longer convergence times (and admittedly "hacky" solution to zero-variance samples), the Gaussian model retains one distinct advantage over its scalar counterpart: edge distances account for any uncertainty due to high variance in the sample of shared ratings. This frequently results in more sensible recommendations than the scalar model (although some of the recommendations frequently appear in both models). 

## TESTING THE MODELS
In order to test the predictive ability of the two models I utilized the "leave-one-out" (LOO) cross validation technique. In this way the network can be left virtually unchanged whilst composing the training data sets. 

## *NOTES*
>###### 1
>*While movies are the recommendation object of interest in these examples, the model is generalizable to any data set that fits a user-product-rating paradigm.*

>###### 2
>*In this iteration of the scalar model the distances in the user network, movie network, and the
 user-movie cross network are scaled the same, assigning each network equal impact on the
 final recommendation. These edge weights could easily be scaled to accomodate one's
 beliefs on the importance each network has in determining the right movie recommendation.
 For instance if one believed that movie similarity was more important than user
 similarity, the edge weights in the movie network plane could be scaled down by some
 factor.*
 
 >###### 3
 >*The constant 1 in the logistic function is replaced with 1000 in order to achieve the desired scaling of the resulting quantity*
