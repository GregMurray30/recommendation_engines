# MODEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
>#### **by Greg Murray**
## INTRODUCTION
The recommender system detailed in this description is a collaborative filtering hybrid model utilizing components of user-based nearest neighbor and item-based nearest neighbor recommenders, as well as basic network theory implemented in PySpark and Python. There are two models used for determining recommendations for users, the Pearson model ([USER_MOVIE_NETWORK.py](https://github.com/GregMurray30/recommendation_engines/blob/master/USER_MOVIE_NETWORK.py)), and the Gaussian model ([USER_MOVIE_NETWORK_gaussian.py](https://github.com/GregMurray30/recommendation_engines/blob/master/USER_MOVIE_NETWORK_gaussian.py)). Aside from their edge weightings, both the Pearson  and Gaussian networks are modelled identically and
utilize Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to generate movie[<sup>1</sup>](#1) recommendations.

The user-movie network is a weighted, non-directed and acyclic graph consisting of two node types, user and movie nodes, with node centrality typically in a skewed normal or power-law-like distribution.

## PEARSON NETWORK MODEL
#### USER NODES
Each node of type user represents an individual user in this network model. The network's edge weights are
calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient (hence the name) of the two users' shared-movies' ratings, as has been demonstrated as the most accurate measurement of similarity between users (Herlocker et al. 1999). For two users, X and Y, then, their sample similarity is defined as 
![alt text](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd1ccc2979b0fd1c1aec96e386f686ae874f9ec0).

Although the weights are non-directed, the user node pairs still show up twice (*X-Y* and *Y-X*) 
in the graph's edge list where **w<sub>*XY*</sub>=w<sub>*YX*</sub>**.

#### MOVIE NODES
The second type of node in this model is the movie node which represent individual movies. Reciprocating the user nodes, the
movie network's edge weights are determined by the two movies' shared-users' ratings, but this time using cosine similarity. For movies A and B then, similarity is defined

#### CROSS EDGES
Cross edges connecting a user node to a movie node indicate the user's rating of that movie
where node **u ∈ G<sub>user</sub>**, and node **v ∈ G<sub>movie</sub>**. In order for a high rating 
to correspond to a small distance, a rating-rank (rating of 5=>1, rating of 4=>2, etc.) is used in for the edge weight in place of the actual rating.

In order to accommodate a belief that an increase in degree separation should correspond to 
a decrease in the similarity regardless of the values of the edge weights, a weighting 
parameter **λ** is added to the distance function, *δ(E)*; compounding the the distance for each node traversal originating from the same node type. Formally, 
  
  > **δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; λ) = λE<sub>uv</sub>**
 
where **nodeType<sub>u</sub>=nodeType<sub>v</sub>.**

#### RECOMMENDATIONS & MODEL ADVANTAGES
Finally, movie recommendations are generated by ranking the user-to-movie traversals by shortest distances.

One of the advantages of using a dual-node-type network model is that the user's movie
ratings, her similarity to other users, and her rated movies' similarities to other
movies are not considered in any arbitrary order, but rather assessed simultaneously[<sup>2</sup>](#2). 
In addition, each node type's edge distances may be weighted according to one's beliefs about the impact 
that particular type.

## GAUSSIAN NETWORK MODEL:

The Gaussian network model is identical to the Pearson network except for the calculation of the
edge weight distances. Where the edge weights in the Pearson model are calculated with the correlation coefficient and cosine similarity, the Gaussian model's edge weights are the probability that the average magnitudinal
difference between two users, or two movies, is greater than some designated threshold parameter **θ**.

**Figure 2:** *A representation of the Gaussian Network Model. The varying thicknesses of each edge line represent different probabilities of similarity. Notice that the movie and user networks are not two separate clusters, but rather an mesh of the two node types inextricably linked by their complex relational edges.*

The model makes the bold assumption that any two nodes' similarity can be modelled with a Gaussian random variable. 

One major disadvantage of the probabilistic approach to edge weights is that since the Gaussian probability density is ![alt text](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4abaca87a10ecfa77b5a205056523706fe6c9c3f "Title"), it is undefined for samples with a variance (**σ<sup>2</sup>**) of zero. It can be shown that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a Gaussian with zero variance is defined as ![alt text](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90400cbbc8895d9f3c9a62d7502ed0f077c6ee3b).
However, because many of the instances with zero variance are clearly more a result of small sample size than two users' unwavering similarity, this CDF is not a practical solution to the zero variance problem (which is really a sample size problem). Instead, when variance is zero, and where the mean difference is less than the threshold parameter **θ**, distance is calculated using a sigmoid function, *δ(n)=e<sup>n</sup>/(1000+e<sup>n</sup>)* [<sup>*</sup>](#3), where **n** is the sample size. In the case where the mean difference is greater than the threshold parameter and the variance is zero, the edge is set equal to infinity, effectively removing the two nodes' connection from the network. Formally, distance in this network is calculated where
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)=Pr[N(μ<sub>uv</sub>, σ<sub>uv</sub>)>θ]**, when **σ<sub>uv</sub>>0** and **μ<sub>uv</sub><=θ**;
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)=1-e<sup>n<sub>uv</uv></sup>/(1000+e<sup>n</sup>)**, when **σ<sub>uv</sub>=0** and **μ<sub>uv</sub><=θ**, where n is the sample size of **E<sub>uv</sub>**;
  
  >**δ(E<sub>uv</sub>; θ)= ∞**, otherwise

## TESTING THE MODELS
In order to test the predictive ability of the two models I utilized the "leave-one-out" (LOO) cross validation technique. In this way the network can be left virtually unchanged whilst composing the training data sets. 

## *NOTES*
>###### 1
>*While movies are the recommendation object of interest in these examples, the model is generalizable to any data set that fits a user-product-rating paradigm.*

>###### 2
>*In this iteration of the scalar model the distances in the user network, movie network, and the
 user-movie cross network are scaled the same, assigning each network equal impact on the
 final recommendation. These edge weights could easily be scaled to accomodate one's
 beliefs on the importance each network has in determining the right movie recommendation.
 For instance if one believed that movie similarity was more important than user
 similarity, the edge weights in the movie network plane could be scaled down by some
 factor.*
 
 >###### 3
 >*The constant 1 in the logistic function is replaced with 1000 in order to achieve the desired scaling of the resulting quantity*
